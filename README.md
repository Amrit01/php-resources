# PHP Code and Knowledge Library

## About

Over the years in PHP community we have noticed that many users meet similar issues and ask questions about PHP
and web development on their PHP journey. We have prepared a living repository that includes a set of PHP related
FAQ - frequently asked questions, PHP tutorials and PHP articles of the [international PHP group on Facebook][fb-group].

There are available many FAQ and tutorials for PHP on the web but for the purposes of this group's specifics this
content should give you some less confusion with your PHP journey as well.

The repository consists of three main sections:

* FAQ - frequently asked questions about PHP

  This section holds most frequently asked questions found in the group and in the PHP community in general.

* Articles

  Articles are more advanced and thorough content about PHP and/or web development.

* Tutorials

  This section holds many useful tutorials to help you get started or learn something new in PHP.
