Sometimes communication in the group goes in the wrong way, low quality is present,
posts that does not relate to the context of the group are shared or some other
reason occurs that would seem to be a good choice to administrators approve
every post that is shared or topic started. Facebook groups have that
functionality.

Administrators of this group have used the approving posts functionality in the
past before but as it turned out this added a lot of extra work to the
group administration process and even more communication loss occured. That
is why we try to solve issues on their regular basis on time and have
group opened for all discussions that follow the group rules.
